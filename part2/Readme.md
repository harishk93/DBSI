# DBSI Project 2 - Part 2

## Introduction
The purpose of the project is to implement a file storage system much like the B-Tree but by doing away with the pointers using intel SSE isntruction set. The tree structure will contain the keys and the result of a search operation will be the index of the range to which the key belongs. The structure supports fanouts of 5,9 and 17. The structure is implemented in C and uses the random generator. It is based on the research paper of Polychroniou and Ross (2014). In addition it also has the implementation of Probing by Binary Search from the reference code provided in class. It uses a customized structure called tree which comprises of the node capacity at each level and the keys at that level. In addition it also has the number of levels which defines that tree. 

## Execution

The project comes with a makefile called "Makefile". This is invoked by the command 
```
make Makefile
```
The Makefile automatically compiles the program to generate the executable file "build". A `GCC` compiler is used and needed for this program to run. 

The program is run through 
```
./build K P fanouts
```
where K is the number of keys that need to be inserted in the structure, P is the number of probes, fanouts are the space separated fanout values for each level starting from the root. Note that in a node with fanout f, there can be f-1 keys. 

## Components

### Random Function and Generating Sample Input
A `p2random.h` is used to generate the random input. The functions `generate_sorted_unique` takes the number of random numbers `n` as a parameter to generate an array containing `n` random 32-bit integers, each unique and the array is sorted. The function `generate` also takes `n` as parameter to generate `n` 32-bit integer values. We use the former to generate the keys and the latter ot generate the probes. 

### Insertion and Probing by Binary Search
The insertion into the tree is through the `build_index` function which takes as input the number of levels in the tree along with the fanout from input and the array of keys. It creates the `struct Tree` and returns that as the value. It uses `posix_memalign` to achieve memory alignment. It also has the function `probe_index` which does the search based on Binary Search. Both of these functions were implemented and submitted as the previous part of the project. This program submitted as part 2 involves code provided by the instructor. 

###Probing
```
uint32_t probe_index2(Tree* tree, int32_t probe_key)
```
We use Intelâ€™s SSE instruction set to perform probing on every level. 
we load delimiters of a node in that level into SIMD register of 128 bits. This register is of type `__m128i`. The probe key is broadcast to all lanes of another SIMD register. We do a SIMD comparison using the `_mm_cmplt_epi32(x,y)` and convert the result to a bit mask using `_mm_movemask_epi18`  which is responsible for creating the bit mask from high bits of 16 bytes. The bitmask will be a 0/-1 value per lane.  Based on the bitmask value we locate the node in the next level to search for. Using `_mm_packs_epi32` we pack the 8x32 bit integers from the two registers into 8x16 bit integers. We repeat this for n levels. 

### Probing Hardcoded 
```
void probe_hardcoded(Tree* tree, __m128i k, uint32_t* result2, uint32_t start):
```
We load the root node of index explicitly into register variable using the following code snippet. 
```
   __m128i cmp_01_a = _mm_cmplt_epi32(lvl_0_a,k1);
   __m128i cmp_01_b = _mm_cmplt_epi32(lvl_0_b,k1);
```
To load and broadcast four keys from input into register variable we use the following code snippet. 
```
  __m128i k=_mm_load_si128((__m128i*)&probe[4*i]) in main.c for each set of 4 keys

  register __m128i k1=_mm_shuffle_epi32(k,_MM_SHUFFLE(0,0,0,0));
  register __m128i k2=_mm_shuffle_epi32(k,_MM_SHUFFLE(1,1,1,1));
  register __m128i k3=_mm_shuffle_epi32(k,_MM_SHUFFLE(2,2,2,2));
  register __m128i k4=_mm_shuffle_epi32(k,_MM_SHUFFLE(3,3,3,3));
```
Rest of the function dollows what probe_index2() does but in this case the entrie loop across three levels is unrolled.
